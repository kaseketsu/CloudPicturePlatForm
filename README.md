A cloud image gallery platform based on Vue 3 + Spring Boot + COS.

## tips
The front-end files are placed in a separate frontend folder. If you want to deploy the project files on a server, you need to replace the information such as YourIp, YourName, etc., in the backend's application-prod.yml file with your own information. At the same time, the PROD-URL in the front-end request.ts file should also be replaced with your own server address.
